        <p>For this website I will be creating a hockey league providing information to parents and kids on what it's all about. I will have a registration page where parents can sign up their kids, I will have a contact page to contact people if parents
            have any more questions. I will have a home page with pictures of players in the league or past players in the league that have been successful and lastly a statistics page to update team stats and player stats throughout the season.</p>
